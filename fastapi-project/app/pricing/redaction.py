"""Naked-cost redaction helpers.

Server-side enforcement of the ``can_view_costs`` rule. When a user is not
permitted to see naked costs, the sensitive cost / profit / margin fields are
stripped (set to ``None``) from the serialized response before it leaves the
router. Price (the sell rate / revenue) is always preserved.

The single source of truth for *whether* a user may see costs lives in
``app.auth.dependencies.user_can_view_costs`` -- this module only decides
*which* fields are sensitive and nulls them when access is denied.
