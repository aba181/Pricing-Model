# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Match AeroVista stack exactly — FastAPI + Next.js 14 + PostgreSQL 15+ with asyncpg raw SQL
- [Init]: Use PyJWT 2.11.0 and pwdlib[argon2] 0.3.0 — python-jose and passlib are unmaintained
- [Init]: All monetary calculations use Python decimal.Decimal and PostgreSQL NUMERIC — never float
- [Init]: Quote immutability is a schema-level decision — store all seven component values and config FK at save time
- [01-01]: BaseRepository uses `from __future__ import annotations` for Python 3.9 dev compatibility while targeting 3.12+ in production
- [01-01]: CORS allows only settings.frontend_url origin with credentials for cookie-based auth
- [01-01]: Default config values in Settings class so app imports without .env file

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Excel workbook has not been reviewed. All Phase 3 estimates are provisional until a full workbook dependency audit is completed. Resolve by scheduling an audit session with the formula owner before Phase 3 planning begins.
